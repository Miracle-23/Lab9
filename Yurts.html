            <h2> The Yurts at Pacific Trails</h2>
    <h3>what is a Yurt?</h3>

Our luxury yurts are permanent structures four feet off the ground. Each yurt is fully 
enclosed with canvas walls, a wooden floor, and a roof dome that can be opened. 

    <h3>How are the yurts furnished?</h3>

Each yurt is furnished with a queen-size bed with down quilt and gas-fired stove. 
Your luxury camping experience includes electricity and a sink with hot and cold
running water. Shower and restroom facilities are located in the lodge.

    <h3>what should I bring?</h3>

Most guests pack comfortable walking shoes and plan to dress for changing weather with light layers of clothing. 
It's also helpful to bring a flashlight and a sense of adventure!
